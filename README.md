# DiceGame

## Rules of the game



DiceGame is a game of rolling dice, one at a time. The object of the game is to not have a pair at the end of the second or third fase. The game is played with **6-sided dice**

- the first **fase** of the **game** is the push. The first die is **rolled** by the **house**.
- The second fase of the game is the play. The **player** then gets three **turns** to roll **dice**, one die each turn. 
- If the player rolls all the dice and there is no **pair** on the table, the player wins and the game ends. The third fase is skipped.
- If at any time, any of the dice on the table form a pair, the second fase ends and fase three starts. 
- In fase three the player gets one last turn. The player rolls a die, called the 'shove'.
- If the outcome of the shove is that there is a **three of a kind** on the table, the player wins. Any other outcome and the player loses.
